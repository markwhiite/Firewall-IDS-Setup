**Purpose**
- The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with firewall deployment and network configuration using **VirtualBox & OPNsense**. I built a virtual lab environment to configure LAN/WAN interfaces, apply firewall rules, and enable IDS/IPS for monitoring malicious traffic. This setup allowed me to observe how firewalls block, log, and detect threats in a controlled environment.

**Tools Used** 
- VirtualBox
- Windows (Target VM)
- Kali Linux (attacker)
- OPNsense

**Overview of Steps**
-  I created Internal & NAT Networks via virtual box to provide an environment where the firewall and linux machine can communicate
-  I set up the IPS and IDS through OPNsense firewall settings.
